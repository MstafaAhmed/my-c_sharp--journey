# My C# Learning Journey
Hi there 
I'm Mostafa Ahmed, and this repository documents my journey of learning the C# programming language.

## Plan:

-  Learn the basics (variables, conditions, loops)
-  Understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
-  Explore advanced topics (LINQ, Delegates, Events)
-  Build a small practical project

## Contents:

Here you will find files and examples for each topic I've studied.



> This repository will be continuously updated as I progress! ðŸš€


Follow my journey as I learn, practice, and grow with C#.
